        print_modifications (Bool) - Option indicating whether potential modifications to unhandled elections
            will be printed during checking

    Notes
        Unhandled elections are elections where at least one major party was unrepresented. Examples are

            When a candidate is unopposed

                If an election was not held, then the average number of votes per district is gotten by
                dividing the total votes cast among other districts in the state where elections were held
                by the number of such districts.

                If an election was held and the candidate won >= 75% of the vote, then modify the votes such
                that if a Republican was unopposed, partition the votes such that the Republican gets 68% of
                the vote total and a hypothetical Democrat gets 32%. If a Democrat was unopposed, then partition
                the votes such that the Democrat gets 70% of the vote total and a hypothetical Republican gets
                30%.

                This modification of votes is done because, in the words of Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos and Eric M. McGhee,
                the authors of the paper Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap in which the efficiency gap was
                defined:

                    "We strongly discourage analysts from either dropping uncontested races from the computation
                    or treating them as if they produced unanimous support for a party. The former approach
                    eliminates important information about a plan, while the latter assumes that coerced votes
                    accurately reflect political support."

                    â€œFor congressional races, we obtained presidential vote share data at the district level, and
                    then ran regressions of vote choice in contested seats on incumbency status and district
                    presidential vote separately for each election year. From this information, we imputed values
                    for uncontested seats. For uncontested Democrats, this procedure resulted in a mean Democratic
                    vote share of 70 percent, with 90 percent of values falling between 56 percent and 87 percent.
                    For uncontested Republicans, it produced a mean Democratic vote share of 32 percent, with 90
                    percent of values falling between 22 percent and 43 percent."


            When only one major party is represented and the candidate won < 75% of the vote

                The election and its minor party or independent candidates are analyzed in order to estimate
                their ideological proximity to either major party and thereby group their votes into the
                corresponding major party.
